# EPRCode
Code to import and process EPR data in MATLAB using Easyspin.

This is a set of MATLAB m-files that I wrote between 2006 and 2012 to process EPR data.  They both extract data from the instrument format, transform it into MATLAB-readable data, and load it into memory (EPR.m).  Once in MATLAB, Easyspin (http://www.easyspin.org/) was used to model the data, but custom models had to be built.  EasyspinAlpha, Benzene, and Tert are those models.   

Everyone is free to use them as the license dictates, but considering the specificity of the application and the wide variety of available software and analysis packages, they may not be relevant to your systems. They are, in general, not sufficiently explained in comments and I will not be updating the comments. I have uploaded them for nostalgic and demonstration reasons.
